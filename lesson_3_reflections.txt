When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  A remote repository can be useful as a backup of my work. It also helps working on
  a project from more than one device or collaborating on a project with other people.
  I can also use it to publish my work for others to use and improve on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To avoid overwriting any local changes.
