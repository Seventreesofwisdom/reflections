When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  A remote repository can be useful as a backup of my work. It also helps working on
  a project from more than one device or collaborating on a project with other people.
  I can also use it to publish my work for others to use and improve on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To avoid overwriting any local changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

    A fork is an online copy of an existing (remote) github repository that can be changed without any
    impact on the original repository. A clone is a copy of a github repository on a computer
    which can be used to make changes to the repository. The changes will only exist locally
    before pushing them to the remote repository. A branch is one version of a repository that
    can be changed independently from other branches of the same repository. A branch would be used
    to do experimental development that may result in an update of the main (master) branch. Bringing
    two branches together is called merging.
