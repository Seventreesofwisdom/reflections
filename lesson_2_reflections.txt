What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	A .git folder is created to store the history of all repository files.
	Without the folder git doesn't know what is part of the repo.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area only contains the things I am planning to commit.
	This way it's possible to divide changes in my working directory
	into multiple commits, for example.
