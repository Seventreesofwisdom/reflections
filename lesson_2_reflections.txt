What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	A .git folder is created to store the history of all repository files.
	Without the folder git doesn't know what is part of the repo.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area only contains the things I am planning to commit.
	This way it's possible to divide changes in my working directory
	into multiple commits, for example.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By staging only the files I want to include in the commit I can divide 
	changes in my working directory into multiple commits. Using git diff it's
	possible to check exactly what will be committed.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches can be used to experiment with new features without disturbing the
	main development branch. They can also help to keep the history clean
	by letting a feature mature on the branch before merging it back.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	
	What kind of a stupid question is that? A diagram is a visualization of
	the branch structure!
